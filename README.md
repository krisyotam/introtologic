# Introduction To Logic by Patrick Suppes

This project uses the book [Introduction to Logic](). It is apart of my [Classical Mathematics](https://github.com/krisyotam/classicalmath) Education. The goal here is to use this book as a foundation for logic in my cirricula. Not at all to an end. I do plan to include thing's here maybe not in the original book, blog posts, articles, ect. that may help better understand a concept. The plan is to at a later point in time implement this into my [Reformed Mathematics]() education, and [Classical Education]() Curricula.
